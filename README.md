# Spare A / Spare B: A Working Hypothesis

_A research-based zine exploring two conflicting layers in the legacy of Austin Osman Spare._
<br>by Le Sorcier Inconnu

## 📘 Overview

Austin Osman Spare (1886–1956) was a visionary British artist and occultist. His legacy has been shaped largely through the writings of Kenneth Grant (1924–2011), a British magician and author who positioned Spare as a prophet of cosmic sorcery and the so-called Zos-Kia Cultus.

As a translator and close reader of Spare’s original texts, I began to notice a dissonance—two irreconcilable layers in the body of his work. These layers, which I call **“Spare A”** and **“Spare B”**, seem to reflect two distinct philosophies that do not blend.

- **Spare A** refers to the early Spare: introspective, anti-religious, deeply artistic, and committed to personal magical practice.
- **Spare B** reflects the mythic, ritualized, and religious overlay largely shaped by Kenneth Grant and others in the posthumous reception of Spare.

This hypothesis is based on a close comparative analysis of Spare’s texts, artwork, and posthumous publications.

## 📑 Contents of the Zine

- **Introduction: A Divided Vision**  
  Sets up the Spare A / Spare B distinction.

- **Table: Works Classified by Type**  
  Lists primary and secondary materials with dates and notes.

- **Section 3–5**  
  Discuss characteristics of Spare A, features of Spare B, and present a working hypothesis.

- **Conclusion**  
  Offers the framework as a research invitation.

- **References**  
  Divided into A-oriented, B-oriented, and hybrid sources.

## 🔍 Methodology

This distinction is not made lightly. It is grounded in:

- Direct translation and analysis of Spare’s five major texts
- Full review of available artwork (including ca. 1950s Egyptian-influenced pieces)
- Contrastive reading of Kenneth Grant’s Typhonian works
- Key secondary sources such as _Phil Baker’s_ biography, which provides a critical and well-documented account of Spare’s life and work
