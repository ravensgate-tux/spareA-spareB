# Spare A / Spare B: A Working Hypothesis
*by Le Sorcier Inconnu*

## 1. Introduction: A Divided Vision
Austin Osman Spare (1886–1956) was a visionary British artist and occultist. His legacy has been shaped largely through the writings of Kenneth Grant (1924–2011), a British magician and author who positioned Spare as a prophet of cosmic sorcery and the so-called Zos-Kia Cultus.

As a translator and close reader of Spare’s original texts, I began to notice a dissonance—two irreconcilable layers in the body of his work. These layers, which I call “Spare A” and “Spare B,” seem to reflect two distinct philosophies that do not blend. The first emerges from Spare’s early writings and artwork: personal, anti-authoritarian, and focused on art, body, and inner experience. The second, by contrast, appears shaped by external editorial hands, notably Kenneth Grant, and introduces systems, cult...

## 3. What We See in Spare A
The Spare A material reveals a radical individualist who rejected religious frameworks and resisted systematization. He believed in the unconscious, bodily will, and personal symbolism. His magic was artistic and internal, not cosmic or hierarchical. There are no gods, demons, or cults—only a man speaking to his inmost self through line, symbol, and trance. His artwork, apart from a few late exceptions, supports this: it is private, flowing, and distinctly non-mythic.

## 4. Spare B: The Mythic Overlay
Spare B is defined by elements introduced or emphasized posthumously—religious language, references to witch cults, formal rituals, and above all, the concept of “Zos-Kia Cultus.” These features align closely with Kenneth Grant’s magical cosmology. While Grant contributed to preserving Spare’s legacy, it’s likely that he also reshaped it to suit his own esoteric system. This applies not only to texts, but also to the interpretation and framing of certain artworks created near the end of Spare’s life.

## 5. A Working Hypothesis
My hypothesis is simple: The image of Spare as a cosmic occultist (Spare B) was constructed—at least in part—by Kenneth Grant during and after the 1950s. This overlay has since dominated how Spare is read, taught, and invoked. But if we strip away the Spare B layer, we may rediscover a much stranger, more intimate thinker—one whose art and philosophy were built not on cult, but on refusal.

This Spare A / Spare B model is grounded in close comparative study of both texts and visual works, and is supported by primary materials and secondary sources, especially Phil Baker’s detailed biographical research, which remains one of the most balanced and critical accounts of Spare’s life and thought.

## 6. Conclusion
I do not claim to have resolved this division. I offer this Spare A / Spare B model as a tool—an invitation for future readers and researchers to re-examine Spare’s works with fresh eyes and a critical approach. This is a hypothesis, not a doctrine. But if it helps others find their way back to Spare’s raw, electric core, it will have served its purpose.
